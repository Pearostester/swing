Notes: 


i wouldent really use the unsupport software and apps 
my friend used it with unsupport app he had to
do something to install it and that was
deleting that app so i rather do it 
because it might also delete windows files
or might make apps unseeable so if your runing 
unsupported os or have unsupported apps 
if found across cant unstall a app or controll panel wont show then just dont install 
this app
